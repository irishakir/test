# Instructions to collaborate in EBRD Digital Transformation

1. Create a Github account (if you already have one, you can avoid this step). Its username will be needed.
    * For guidance on the establishment of a GitHub account and the first steps, see the following manual: [How to work with EBRDâ€™s GitHub](https://github.com/EBRDDigitalTransformation/EBRD-Digital-Transformation/blob/master/Manuals/EBRD_Manual%20for%20Creation%20of%20a%20GitHub_Repository_v1.docx)

2. Ask the manager, Eliza Niewiadomska (NiewiadE@ebrd.com), to create a new Organization in the GitHub. The following information must be provided:
    * The name of the Organization, which will be something similar to *EBRD-Digital-Transformation-ProjectName*. Therefore, the URL of the Organization will be: https://github.com/EBRD-ProjectName.
    * The Github account of the collaborator.
  
3. Once the Organization is created, the manager will use the collaborator's Github account in order to add it as member of the Organization, so that the collaborator is able to create the repositories.

4. Create the repositories inside the Organization. Each repository must include:
    * At least one branch (master) with the source code.
    * ***README.md*** file with a brief description of the initial commit / new features of the version. It is mandatory to keep updated this file, referencing the **version number**.
    * License for each repository containing source code as [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/lgpl-3.0/) or [Apache License 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) (upon EBRD Operation Leader's approval).
    * Create or update the *wiki* tab related to the repository. The main goal of this wiki is to store all the functional and technical documentation related to the repository. The documentation can be added in the following ways:
      * Directly as *wiki* sections (recommended) with a table of contents.
      * Attaching documentation in files, such as Word, Excel, images, etc. Sections must be created in order to keep ordered the documentation.
      * Prepare a wiki summary of the project following the recommended template: https://github.com/EBRDDigitalTransformation/DigitalTools/wiki/Template-for-summary-case-study
